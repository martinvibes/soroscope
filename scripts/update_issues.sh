**Description**
The Liquidity Pool contract is the core of our DEX, but currently lacks inline documentation.

**Goal**
Add Rustdoc comments to public functions and structs to improve developer onboarding and code maintainability.

**Context**
The \`LiquidityPool\` contract uses the Soroban SDK. We need standard Rustdoc comments (\`///\`) for all public functions and structs so that \`cargo doc\` produces useful output.

**Requirements**
- Check \`contracts/liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs\`.
- Ensure \`initialize\`, \`deposit\`, \`swap\`, and \`withdraw\` have clear descriptions of parameters and return values.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Use standard Rust documentation style.
- Verification: Run \`cargo doc\` to ensure it compiles without warnings.

**Complexity**
Trivial (100 points): Documentation only.

# Issue #42

**Description**
Edge cases in DeFi contracts can lead to unexpected behavior. We need to verify robustness against zero-value inputs.

**Goal**
Verify that the \`deposit\` function handles zero amounts correctly (either by rejecting them or handling them gracefully).

**Context**
Current tests cover standard flows. We need a specific test case for \`amount_a = 0\` and \`amount_b = 0\`.

**Requirements**
- Add a test case in \`contracts/liquidity_pool/src/test.rs\`.
- Assert that the transaction either fails with a specific error or results in 0 shares minted without panic.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Look at existing tests in \`test.rs\` for pattern.
- Create a new test function \`test_deposit_zero_amount\`.

**Complexity**
Trivial (100 points): Single test case.

**Commitment**

# Issue #43
cat <<EOF > /tmp/issue_43.md
**Description**
Magic numbers in error reporting make debugging and maintaining validity checks difficult.

**Goal**
Refactor error codes to use explicit constants or enum variants coverage across the module.

**Context**
The \`Error\` enum in \`contracts/liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs\` is already an enum, but some logic might still be using raw numbers or implicit casts.

**Requirements**
- Scan \`lib.rs\` for any hardcoded integer returns in \`Err(...)\`.
- Replace them with \`Error::Variant\`.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Ensure no logic change, only refactoring.
- Run \`cargo test\` to ensure no regressions.

**Complexity**
Trivial (100 points): Code cleanup.

**Commitment**

**Description**
Events are crucial for indexers and UIs to track contract activity.

**Goal**
Ensure that the token contract (or our usage of it) emits the expected events during operations.

**Context**
The \`LiquidityPool\` emits \`Deposit\`, \`Swap\`, and \`Withdraw\` events. We need to verify these are actually emitted with the correct data in \`test.rs\`.

**Requirements**
- Extend \`test_events\` in \`contracts/liquidity_pool/src/test.rs\`.
- Assert the *content* of the events match the transaction details.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Use \`e.events().all()\` to inspect the event log.
- Match against expected topics and data.

**Complexity**
Trivial (100 points): Test assertion updates.

# Issue #45
cat <<EOF > /tmp/issue_45.md
**Description**
Our LP Share token needs to support the standard \`approve\` pattern (allowance) for third-party compatibility.

**Goal**
Implement the \`approve\` function to allow third-party contracts to spend user shares.

**Context**
To be fully compatible with the Soroban Token Interface (SEP-41), we must support allowances.

**Requirements**
- Implement \`approve(e: Env, from: Address, spender: Address, amount: i128, expiration_ledger: u32)\`.
- Store allowances in \`Persistent\` storage.
- Add \`allowance\` read function.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Use \`DataKey::Allowance(AllowanceDataKey)\` pattern for storage.
- Ensure proper authorization checks (\`from.require_auth()\`).

**Complexity**
Medium (150 points): State change and authorization logic.

# Issue #46
cat <<EOF > /tmp/issue_46.md
**Description**
Completes the standard token interface by adding \`transfer_from\`.

**Goal**
Allow a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of an owner, up to the approved allowance.

**Context**
Depends on #45 (Approve). This is the second half of the allowance mechanism.

**Requirements**
- Implement \`transfer_from(e: Env, spender: Address, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128)\`.
- Check that \`allowance >= amount\`.
- Decrement allowance and perform transfer.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Reuse \`transfer\` logic if possible or extract shared logic.
- Ensure atomicity.

**Complexity**
Medium (150 points): Interdependent state logic.

# Issue #47

**Description**
A raw \`burn\` function allows users to voluntarily destroy shares without withdrawing assets.

**Goal**
Implement a \`burn\` function for deflationary mechanisms or proof-of-burn.

**Context**
Currently, shares are only burned during \`withdraw\` (which returns assets). This new function should burn shares *without* returning assets (increasing the value of remaining shares).

**Requirements**
- Implement \`burn(e: Env, from: Address, amount: i128)\`.
- Reduce \`TotalShares\` and user balance.
- Do *not* send any tokens back to the user.
- Emit \`Burn\` event.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Ensure \`from\` has enough balance.
- Update \`TotalShares\` storage.

**Complexity**
Medium (150 points): State manipulation and event emission.

# Issue #48
cat <<EOF > /tmp/issue_48.md
**Description**
Security mechanism to stop contract operations in emergencies.

**Goal**
Allow an admin to pause deposits and swaps to prevent loss of funds during an incident.

**Context**
We need a \`paused\` state that acts as a circuit breaker for all state-changing functions.

**Requirements**
- Add \`Admin\` state to the contract (initialized in \`initialize\`).
- Add \`set_paused(e: Env, paused: bool)\`.
- Add checks in \`deposit\`, \`swap\`, \`withdraw\` to revert if \`paused\` is true.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Define \`DataKey::Admin\` and \`DataKey::Paused\`.
- Create a helper \`check_paused(&e)\` to reduce code duplication.

**Complexity**
Medium (150 points): Access control and state management.

# Issue #49
cat <<EOF > /tmp/issue_49.md
**Description**
The protocol fee is currently hardcoded and immutable.

**Goal**
Make the swap fee adjustable by the admin, within safe limits.

**Context**
We need flexibility to adjust fees (e.g., 0.1% to 1%) without upgrading the entire contract.

**Requirements**
- Store \`FeeBasisPoints\` in storage (default 30).
- Valid range check: 0 to 100 bps.
- Update \`swap\` formula to use the stored fee.
- Add admin function \`set_fee\`.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Reuse \`Admin\` key from #48 if available, or create new.
- Ensure math handles the dynamic variable correctly (overflow checks).

**Complexity**
High (200 points): Mathematical implications and access control.

# Issue #50

**Description**
Constant product formula verification across the entire input space.

**Goal**
Ensure the swap formula \`x * y = k\` never violates invariants (never decreases k) through fuzz testing.

**Context**
Edge cases with large numbers or small numbers can cause rounding issues. Fuzzing explores these edge cases automatically.

**Requirements**
- Use \`soroban-sdk\` test fuzzing capabilities or \`proptest\`.
- Define invariants: \`k_after >= k_before\`.
- Test with max \`i128\` values.

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Write a property-based test.
- Run it with a large number of iterations.

**Complexity**
High (200 points): Advanced testing techniques.

**Commitment**
Please provide an ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) when requesting to be assigned to this issue. Failure to provide an ETA may result in the assignment being delayed or rejected.
